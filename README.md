# Notes
#### Variables:

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. Variable names can use letters, digits (0-9), underscore (_) and $.The 1st character in a variable name can't be a digit. Also variable names can't contain spaces.
For example: 
```
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```
#### Alert Command:

This command displays a message box. It can either be denoted using ' or ". Here's an example:
```
alert(‘Hello, Welcome to my page!’)
```
#### Prompt Command:

It displays a question box. 

# Code
```
var name = prompt('What is your name?') 
var age = prompt('What is your age?') 
var gender = prompt('What is your gender?') 
var feedback = prompt('Feedback:') 
alert('Thanks for your time'+ name) 
```
